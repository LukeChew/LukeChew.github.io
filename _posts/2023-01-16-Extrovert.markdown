Ever since I was a toddler, I've been introverted.

My Mom has told me that, when we were very young, my sister would always want someone else to play with her. I, on the other hand, was always content to play on my own. 

Throughout most of my school life, I've had a small number of friends. Grade 12 was pretty much the only time I'd say I had a relatively large group of people I hung out with, but then we got an announcement that our March break of 2020 would be three weeks long instead of one. Then, of course, came months of isolation, during which I saw no one outside my family. This was mostly fine with me, though: I was content to stay home playing video games and reading books.

Then University started. During first year I was on campus, and had a bit of socializing among the people on my floor, but didn't really make any long-lasting, close friendships. And it was expensive. So for all of my second year and my first 3 co-ops, I stayed at home. For 16 months I stayed at home, sometimes not leaving the house for weeks at a time. I saw my friends about 5 times in that span. My mental health and motivation were suffering. 

Last September, I had my first non-remote job, a hybrid position in downtown Toronto. Actually going into the office and meeting people, I realized that, though I think of myself as an introvert, I do want at least a bit of human contact in my life, especially with those I consider friends. 

Realizing this, I started actively making efforts to see my friends, and entering the first academic term of 2023, I wanted to at least try to meet more new people, so that I wouldn't always have to bother the same 3 or so friends when I wanted socialization. In this first week since moving in, I frequented the lounge, and have had some interesting conversations with whoever walked in there.

Most importantly, Wednesday I walked in on a group of 5 friends that had been there for a while and were essentially just bored together. So, seeing an opportunity for some fun, I sat down with them and started entertaining them with random topics of conversation. One thing they been discussing was their Myers-Briggs personality types, so I mentioned that in the past I had been categorized as INTP.

They were surprised I wasn't an extrovert.

This shocked me. What shocked me more was when I did another MBTI test and it came up as ENFP. Even further, I read that it is common for ENFPs to think they are introverts. I took another test and got the same result.

Ultimately, personality types are naturally a lot more complicated than two test results at a single point in my life, but I now wonder:

Have I actually liked people this whole time?
