Consider the word "state". It can mean a lot of different things in the English language:

1. An institution which governs a certain area
2. A part of the USA
3. The current happenings of something ("what is the current state of \[thing\]?")
4. A classification of matter: solid, liquid, gas, plasma
5. What is currently being held by a computer's memory
6. The action of saying something

Taking 5 of those 6 meanings, the question:

"What does the state state about the state of the state of the state of Georgia?"

Is something you can legitmately ask about the contents of a computer concerning the government of a US state. And it's fun to say, too!

May your states be well,
