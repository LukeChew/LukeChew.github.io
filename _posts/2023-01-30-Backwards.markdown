This is intended to be the first part of a long series about how to speak backwards english. No, I'm not joking.

However, before I dive into that monster of a topic, I want to establish a relatively easy way I've come up with of writing out english phonetically, to accurately represent the pronounciation of backwards things. However, it can also be applied to normal english and get more consistent spellings that make more sense in tandem with what the speaker actually says. Know that this is far from perfect, but is good enough for my purposes.

I realize it would be convenient if I had a name to call this spelling by. Completely arbitrary, I've decided to call it Yevethan English.

The fundamental idea is that, except for a few consonant combinations like "ch", every letter is always pronounced the same. 

For the vowels, you always pronounce them as you would when the particular vowel is placed in the word b_t (I didn't explicitly design it this way, but it's a very good mnemonic). So:

A: always long AH sound ("b**a**t")

E: long EH sound ("b**e**t")

I: short ih sound ("b**i**t")

O: long AW sound ("b**o**t")

U: short uh sound ("b**u**t")

Y is NEVER a vowel. 

Now some of you may be wondering how we'll get sounds like ee and ay. Don't worry, I'll get there!

Now for the consonants. Except for the aforementioned combinations, these all generally take their most intuitive pronounciation.
B, D, F, H, K, L, M , N, P, R, S, T, V, W, Z are all pretty obvious.

C: since we already have K and Q making the hard K sound and S making the ssss sound, C will take the place of what we normally write as "sh" in English. **Sh**ield

G: always hard GUH sound, **g**un

J: soft juh sound, like in **j**uice

X: will make a soft z sound, like in confu**si**on

Y: always the soft consonant sound. **Y**oung

And now for the consonant combinations you'll need to watch for:

ng - the noise you make at the end of the sounds spelt -ing, -ong, -ang

th - the version of -th in the words **th**ing, **th**ink, steal**th**

dh - the version of -th in the words **th**e, **th**em, **th**ere

oo - the vowel sound in w**oo**d, and the vowel part of w**o**rd, pow**e**r

Now that all the individual sounds are defined, we can move to the vowel sounds that are actually multiple sounds in disguise. But I'll save that for next week! And for those who are confused, don't worry. I'll provide plenty of examples in part 2 and throughout future articles in this series.

Thanks for reading!
