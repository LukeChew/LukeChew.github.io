I"m writing this just before 9pm on Sunday. I've had a lovely day with a friend, where we did two things we'd been planning for a week or so and generally enjoyed each other's company.

Despite, or perhaps because of, this I feel sad. The type of sad that, if I allow it to, will take me over and have me questioning my entire existence and the point of human life itself.

This is not the first time I've felt this way recently, and I'm choosing to take a somewhat masochistic view to these moods. 

Instead of simply being sad, I am going to do all I can (within reason) to exacerbate my despair. I'm going to put on tragic music, reminisce on the tragedies of my life, and generally wallow in complete misery to the best of my ability, until my mind gets over this. AFter all, having a bad day is nothing to be alarmed about. It'll only make the good ones shine brighter, and isn't that wonderful? :\)
