Funny how life works sometimes. Last week I wrote about my random spell of sadness, and how I was going to purposefully embrace the sadness until I got over it.

Well, I had no such opportunity. Shortly after writing that post, my roommate walked into the kitchen area where I was sitting and we had a pleasant chat. After that, though I was still in a bit of a funk, I no longer wanted to induce despair in myself.

After that, I tried going to bed early, but after lying idle for a few minutes, I suddenly became overcome with a great many thoughts. I am now determined to try out the fencing club next term, and I've now finished the book about classical music I'd been reading for a month or so.

Ultimately, I don't think there's too much of a lesson or moral to be had there, except maybe that some sadness fades easily? I'm not sure. But I'm glad I had that experience.
