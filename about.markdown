My name is Luke Chew. I'm a mathematics undergrad student at the University of Waterloo. 

I've long had an interest in creating a personal site, and recently I was encouraged to start a blog. So here you go! I make no guarantees about the quality of the content on this site, but I hope you find something that amuses you.
